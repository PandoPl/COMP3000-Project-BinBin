# BinBin
Supervisor: Nancy Girdhar

Project Vision:
BinBin is a helpful companion that will detect if your bin is full and whether your bin contains recyclables that donâ€™t belong there. It encourages the user to keep responsible recycling habits.

The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a bin is full and a camera that uses a lightweight AI model to determine if waste items are being disposed of correctly. If a recyclable is detected in the wrong bin, BinBin will send a notification to the user to alert them of this issue.

The goal of this project is to create a prototype that can demonstrate a smarter approach to waste management which will reduce contamination in recycling streams and promote sustainability in everyday environments such as in homes, offices, and schools.
